    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>My project is called ‘Thread of life’. </p>
    <p>My chosen pairing is the adjective Interwoven and Information design.</p>
    <p>I came up with the concept after looking at these embroidery photographs by Morimoto and Anzeri.
    In these photos, faces are sewed together, making me feel the inseparable connection between people.</p> 
    <p>However, my approach is quite different. </p>
    <p>In this design, I’d like to express the interwoven connection of the past, the present and the future of a person. For me, these 3 stages of life are what define us as human.
    The past makes you today and the present is the foundation of the future. This is my interpretation of the phrase ‘interwoven’. </p>
    <p>On the website, I’d like it to be a digital gallery of illustrations that recreate my past, present and future visualising as a Kumihimo thread disk. Displaying photos/illustrations is the main purpose of this website. </p>
    <p> There are 3 main colours: purple, yellow and red depict each stage of life.</p>
    <p>Past-purple: illustration of a younger self who could not love herself and struggle from mental illness. </p>
    <p>Present-yellow: illustration portrays my current state of mind which is peaceful and on the journey of self-love. 
        There are a lot of flowers growing on her head as an indication for the synonym “Birds are perch in safe land”. As having a healthier mentality, it becomes a great environment for flowers to grow, birds come to perch. </p>
    <p> Future-red: illustration of a heart is clutched on my arms, embodying my wish to give my sincerity to others. However, the heart is also dripping in a red liquid. There is a double meaning to it. 
        The red liquid can be overflowing love from others getting back to me, or it can be my blood dripping because someone may wants to take advantage of my kindness. 
        This is a reminder for myself to be kind but also be wise.
    </p>
    <p> Web users can click on each thread to see the illustration.
        My initial plan was to create a series of photos or illustrations for each thread, so it could appear like a chain, which aligns with the concept of interwoven. However, due to time-constraint I was only able to make 3 illustrations representing my past, present and future-self. 
        Thus, I did a little modification. There is still the image carousel instead of going through same-concept illustrations, you will move between the past, the present and future. Your past leads to your present and then future.  
    </p>
    <p>At first, I planned to hide the carousel arrow. I found it the key element of the interwoven concept. They are the knot to connect the past to the present and further. Thus, I kept them at 60% opacity and when hovering they would be at 100% in order to keep the user's focus on the illustration. 
        You can also click outside the background (on the overlay) to return to the main page.
