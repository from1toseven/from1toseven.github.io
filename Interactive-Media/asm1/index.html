        <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p>When I first opened the website, the palette of green and yellow was very aesthetically pleasing and reminded me of a novel by Nguyen Nhat Anh titled <em>Yellow floweres on the green grass</em>, 
            which might be due to the fact that the creator has a Viet surname and this is a digital poem as well. The headings of some verses were related to the natural theme leading me to expect a sophisticated and harmonic experience, and it was. 
            My first interaction with the website was to click on the heading <em>beetle</em> leading to the green line underneath opened to show the verse. This motion reminded me of opening a poem book.
            </p>
        <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        <p id="li"> <ol> 
            <li>Clicked on the first heading <em>the beetle</em></li> 
            <li>Clicked on the second heading <em>delay</em></li> 
            <li>Went back and clicked on the box of the first verse to see if it would close and pause the music.</li>
            <li>Continued to click on other headings from left to right until the end.</li>
            <li>Clicked on the cross symbol at the bottom of the website.</li>
            <li>Clicked on one of the references (?) to see where it would head to.</li>
            <li>Clicked on the <em>Mute</em>.</li>
            <li>Clicked on the <em>Sound on</em> to get the audio back</li>
            <li>Clicked on the title <em>7 Poems by Justin Nguyễn</em></li></ol></p>
        <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>The most interesting element for me would be the boxes of poem verses. I kept clicking on each box to see if it would close and how the melody would be affected if it did.
            Personally, I really enjoyed the final version when every layer of sound already came, but it was fine even with just one sound. And it is a fantastic sound production 
            because every layer is well composed and put together regardless of the users’ interaction</p>
        <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <p>I think the only required action is clicking. I tried different actions like dragging and double-clicking, but nothing happened.</p>
        <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <p>I think this experience’s intended primary goal has a similar concept to an artist’s digital gallery, in which their works/messages can be stored/displayed while reaching a broader audience. 
            Or perhaps, the creator would like to encourage more users to know poetry by creating a fun interactive experience.</p>
        <h3>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
        <p>Regardless of its purpose, I was impressed with the whole experience. 7 Poems was a phenomenal interaction both visually and sonically. It successfully piqued my interest in poetry.</p>
        <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)?</h3>
        <p> After experiencing for a few times, I reckon at first, users would go through every element of the interaction to explore its function in the first few minutes. 
            It took me around 10 minutes to discover the entire operation and listen to every sound. Then, users may get time to read and digest each poem and keep the interaction going on. 
            The second try should take longer, depending on the user’s interest in the poem. If they like any word of the poem, the motion graphic can be stopped by clicking the box. 
            Once all the boxes stop, the sound will gradually fade as well. The second interaction should take roughly 20-30 minutes. 
            The users can restart the experience by clicking the title <em>7 Poems by Justin Nguyễn.</em></p>
        <h3>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p>The interaction flowed naturally. The visual cues were apparent to ensure that all the poems were explored. 
            The audio suggests that the poems would be read in a relaxing and zen-like environment. 
            Gradually, this can be a recreational place in which people can feel calm and collected. I personally think that after each poem, there should be a full version for clarity.</p>
        <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <p>I think the motion graphics resemble the action of opening a book, which was well suited for a digital poem demonstration.</p>
        <h3>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3>
        <p>I don’t think the book reference intrigued me to click. I just knew that I should click on something to start the experience because clicking is the primary action for web users. 
            It was still a good design choice fitting the simplicity and delicate interface’s aesthetic.</p>
        <h3>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned, the experience produces relaxing, pleasant feelings, similar to how you usually feel when reading a book. 
            And it was interesting at the same time to see a poem in digital format and how music and motions can be incorporated to become a more fun experience. </p>
        <h3>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you, and what makes it frustrating?</h3>
        <p>It was hard to keep up with the verse because the words kept transitioning in a second.
             I also found the pacing quite weird, but it could be because I’m unfamiliar with the poem’s structure. </p>
        <h3>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3>
        <p>The most satisfying part about the interaction has to be the new sound appearing whenever you open a new poem. And when every element (sound, the poems, the motions) finally blended together, it was a wonderful experience. 
            It somehow generated a fulfilling feeling as the user was a part of the creation.</p>
